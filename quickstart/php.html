<h1>PHP Quickstart Tutorial</h1>

<p>The ReportingCloud PHP SDK makes it easy to interact with ReportingCloud from any PHP 7.1 or newer application. The most recent version of the SDK can be found on <a href="https://github.com/TextControl/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud-php">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>This quickstart tutorial shows how to create your first PHP application using ReportingCloud.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ol class="background-list">
    <li>
        <p>In order to use the ReportingCloud PHP SDK, you will need at least a trial account for ReportingCloud. How to register and to create a free trial account is described here: <a href="../introduction/trial#Sign-up-for-your-Free-Trial-Account">Sign up for your Free Trial Account</a></p>
        <p>
            <a target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary" href="https://portal.reporting.cloud/Account/Register/">Create Trial Account</a>
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Create an API Key for your api calls. How API Keys are managed is described here: <a href="../introduction/apikey#Manage-API-Keys">Manage API Keys</a></p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Check Your PHP Version</h2>

<p>
    Since all versions of PHPs prior to 7.1 have reached end-of-life and consequently, no further security updates will be released for them, the PHP SDK only supports PHP 7.1 or newer.
    Check you are running PHP 7.1 or newer, by opening your terminal and executing:
</p>

<p class="nuget">php --version</p>

<p>The output should be something like this:</p>

<p class="nuget">
    PHP 7.1.26-2+0~20190216175340.13+stretch~1.gbpc20626 (cli) (built: Feb 16 2019 17:53:40) ( NTS )<br />
    Copyright (c) 1997-2018 The PHP Group<br />
    Zend Engine v3.1.0, Copyright (c) 1998-2018 Zend Technologies<br />
    with Zend OPcache v7.1.26-2+0~20190216175340.13+stretch~1.gbpc20626, Copyright (c) 1999-2018, by Zend Technologies
</p>

<p>The PHP version number in this case is PHP 7.1.26, which is compatible to the PHP SDK.</p>

<h2>Create a New Project</h2>

<p>Next, we need to create a new project, by executing the following in the terminal:</p>

<p class="nuget">mkdir my-application && cd my-application</p>

<p>We have created a new directory, into we will install the PHP SDK.</p>

<p>To install the PHP SDK, we use <a target="_blank" href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>. If you do not already have Composer installed on your system, please refer to the Composer <a target="_blank" href="https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md">documentation</a>. In the terminal, execute:</p>

<p class="nuget">composer require textcontrol/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud:^2.0</p>

<p>The output should be something like this:</p>

<p class="nuget">
    ./composer.json has been created<br />
    Loading composer repositories with package information<br />
    Updating dependencies (including require-dev)<br />
    Package operations: 8 installs, 0 updates, 0 removals<br />
    - Installing symfony/polyfill-ctype (v1.10.0): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing webmozart/assert (1.4.0): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing guzzlehttp/promises (v1.3.1): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing ralouphie/getallheaders (2.0.5): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing psr/http-message (1.0.1): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing guzzlehttp/psr7 (1.5.2): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing guzzlehttp/guzzle (6.3.3): Loading from cache<br />
    - Installing textcontrol/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud (2.1.0): Loading from cache<br />
    guzzlehttp/guzzle suggests installing psr/log (Required for using the Log middleware)<br />
    Writing lock file<br />
    Generating optimized autoload files
</p>

<p>Congratulations! You now have successfully installed the PHP SDK.</p>

<h2>Create Your First PDF File</h2>

<p>Now, open your favorite IDE or text editor, and enter the following, adding your API key to the 'api_key' key of the constructor's options array (line 11):</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/jonathanmaron/50d5066739229c7ada75841fa542072c.js"></script>

<p>Save the file with the filename <code>demo.php</code> and execute in the terminal:</p>

<p class="nuget">php demo.php</p>

<p>The output should be something like this:</p>

<p class="nuget">Written to "test_template_merged.pdf".</p>

<p>You can now open the PDF file in your favorite PDF viewer.</p>

<p>So, what is going in in the above code snippet?</p>

<ol>
    <li><p>On line 2, we turn on strict_types, to ensure that types are enforced by PHP.</p></li>
    <li><p>On line 4, we include Composer's autoloader file, so that the PHP SDK and dependencies are correctly autoloaded.</p></li>
    <li><p>On lines 6 to 8, we import the PHP SDK.</p></li>
    <li><p>On lines 10 to 12, we instantiate the main ReportingCloud component.</p></li>
    <li><p>On line 14, we define the filename of the template file. This is a very simple template that ships with the PHP SDK for demonstration purposes.</p></li>
    <li><p>On line 15, we define the filename of the output PDF file.</p></li>
    <li><p>On lines 17 to 20, we define the merge data -- that is the data that will be inserted into the template.</p></li>
    <li><p>On lines 22 to 27, we send all the above to the ReportingCloud service, and are returned with an array of binary data.</p></li>
    <li><p>On line 29, we write the binary data to disk.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Congratulations! You have now completed your very first mail-merge operation using ReportingCloud.</p>

<h2>What Comes Next?</h2>

<p>The PHP SDK ships with a number of demo applications, which illustrate all parts of ReportingCloud. To view this demos, please take a look at directory <code>vendor/textcontrol/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud/demo</code>, either on your file system, or in the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/TextControl/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud-php/tree/master/demo">GitHub repository</a>.</p>
