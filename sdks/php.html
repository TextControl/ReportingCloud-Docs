<h1>ReportingCloud PHP SDK</h1>

<p>The ReportingCloud PHP SDK makes it easy to interact with ReportingCloud from your PHP web application.</p>

<h2>Minimum Requirements</h2>

<p>The ReportingCloud PHP SDK requires PHP 7.1 or newer. All versions of PHPs prior to 7.1 have reached end-of-life and consequently, no further security updates will be released for them. If your application is running in an older environment, it is highly advisable to update to a more current version of PHP.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>

<p>Install the ReportingCloud PHP SDK in your project using <a target="_blank" href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a>:</p>

<p class="nuget">composer require textcontrol/txtextcontrol-reportingcloud:^2.0</p>

<p>After installing, you need to include Composer's autoloader:</p>

<p class="nuget">include_once 'vendor/autoload.php';</p>

<p>You can then later update the ReportingCloud PHP SDK using Composer:</p>

<p class="nuget">composer update</p>

<p>For best auto-loading performance execute:</p>

<p class="nuget">composer dump-autoload --optimize</p>

<h2>Open Source Project</h2>
