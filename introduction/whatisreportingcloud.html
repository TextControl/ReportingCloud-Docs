<h1>What is ReportingCloud?</h1>

<p>ReportingCloud makes the creation of documents very easy.</p>

<p>ReportingCloud is a cloud service to generate documents using an HTTP RESTful Web API. The basic idea is to use MS Word compatible templates with placeholders (merge fields) and repeating merge blocks and to merge them with data from hierarchical JSON arrays.</p>

<p>This concept allows developers to create pixel-perfect documents in industry-standard formats such as Adobe PDF, DOC, DOCX or RTF based on MS Word templates.</p>

<p>ReportingCloud can be called from any platform and any client such as .NET, JavaScript, PHP, Node.JS, jQuery, Python, Android, Java and iOS.</p>
