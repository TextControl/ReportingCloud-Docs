<h1>ReportingCloud Portal Overview</h1>

<p>The portal is your hub to manage templates, data source excerpt files and to manage your account. The portal can be found at <a href="https://portal.reporting.cloud/">https://portal.reporting.cloud</a>. The portal gives you an overview of your recent activities, the service status and your usage quota.</p>

<h2>Manage Templates</h2>

<p>ReportingCloud allows you to upload templates to the template storage. The major advantage to create documents from templates that are stored in the template storage is performance. Instead of sending the document with your request, the template is loaded from the ReportingCloud template storage which saves bandwidth and therefore request time.</p>

<h2>Data Source Excerpt Files</h2>

<p>A datasource excerpt file is used to fill the drop-down lists of the template editor with proper merge fields, relations and dummy data for a template preview. A datasource excerpt file is not your actual data that is used to merge your template. It helps you to design your templates and to insert the proper field names.</p>

<p>The format of the datasource excerpt file is the same as the accepted datasource of the Merge Web API method. It is a JSON string containing an array of objects.</p>

<p>The portal allows you to create and modify these excerpt files:</p>
