<h2>Trial Account Restrictions</h2>

<p>The trial account provides most functionality that is offered with paid accounts. However, there are some restrictions and limitations while in trial mode.</p>

<h5>Adobe PDF/A Support</h5>

<p>The trial account can only create DOC, DOCX, RTF, HTML and PDF documents. All documents contain a watermark. Additionally, the ISO standard format for PDF archiving PDF/A is not supported using the trial account.</p>
